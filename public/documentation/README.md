###Default Project
This is merely an empty default project from which to start new projects.
The idea is to provide a quick scaffolding that includes testing and documentation.  It's really aimed more towards javascript-heavy applications.

###Features
<pre class="brush: gherkin">
Feature: Triage incoming calls  
As a developer  
I want my documentation to look nice  
So that I can more effectively communicate with other stakeholders  

Scenario: Default gherkin spec  
Given that I write a gherkin spec  
When I load it into a browser  
Then I will see pretty colors  
</pre>
