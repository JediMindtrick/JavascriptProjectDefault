###Default Project
This is merely an empty default project from which to start new projects.
The idea is to provide a quick scaffolding that includes testing and documentation.  It's aimed towards javascript-heavy applications. foo.

###Features
<pre class="brush: gherkin">
Feature: Triage incoming calls  
As a CSR manager  
I want a wizard application to help my CSRs triage incoming calls  
So that we can more efficiently route callers to expert help  

Scenario: Default gherkin spec  
Given that I write a gherkin spec  
When I load it into a browser  
Then I will see pretty colors
